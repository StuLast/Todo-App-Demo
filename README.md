##  Installation

You can grab the code for this app from https://github.com/StuLast/Todo-App-Demo

##  Running locally

The repo contains a local server to emulate a web server, so can serve up the web application as if it were coming from a real web server.  This server also tracks changes and will reload automatically when changes are made.

The script to run the server has already been defined in the package.json file.  To run the server enter the following into a terminal/bash/console app.

```npm run dev```

This will start a local web server, usually with the ip address http:/127.0.0.1:8080 and should automatically start up your default web browser.
